You are required to develop an inventory management system using Python that allows the store owner to perform the following tasks:

1. Add New Item: Prompt the user to enter details such as item name, price, and quantity for a new item. Store this information in the inventory.
2. Update Stock: Allow the user to update the quantity of existing items in the inventory.
3. Generate Sales Report: Calculate the total revenue generated from sales. This should include the total revenue for each item and the overall revenue for all items sold.
4. Popular Items: Identify the top three most popular items based on sales quantity.
5. Exit: Provide an option for the user to exit the program.

Requirements
1. Utilize variables to store item details such as name, price, and quantity.
2. Receive input from the user to add new items and update stock quantities.
3. Implement string formatting to display item details and sales reports.
4. Use string methods to manipulate item names (e.g., convert to uppercase).
5. Perform arithmetic operations to calculate total revenue.
6. Utilize if statements to handle logical operations such as checking for popular items and managing the exit option.
7. Implement while and for loops as necessary for iterating through inventory items and generating reports.
8. Ensure the program handles user input errors gracefully.

Required Deliverables:
1. Deliver a Python script (.py file) containing the implementation of the inventory management system.
2. Deliver a document or screenshot showing the output of the program, including sample interactions with the user (adding items, updating stock, generating reports, etc.).
3. Provide a brief explanation of the code structure and any design decisions made during implementation.
